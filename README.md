# TicTacToe-in-Java

This is one of the earliest projects I undertook when learning object oriented programming. It exposed me to the principles of objects, polymorphism, inheritance, exception handling and much more! 

I now try to replicate this project as a way to learn new languages. At the moment I am doing this in Ruby.
